# Todo List Web Api

## Context
In this project a Web api which allows a user to keep track of pending and completed tasks.

In the application, users can do the following:

* get the list of unfinished tasks
* get the list of completed tasks
* Create tasks
* Edit tasks
* Complete tasks
* Delete tasks

## Business Constraints
* Must not allow duplicated tasks
* Tasks must not be more than 240 characters

## Technical Constraints
* Springboot OR NodeJS (as directed)
* Any storage (in memory, relational, nosql)

## Project Submission

The whole project including the source code, tests and simple documentation about how to run the program

Perferably, send us a link to a public repository including the above

## Expectations

We're not just looking for any old solution that would solve the problem. We're looking for:

* production quality code
* good Object Oriented or functional practices
* a solid testing approach
* well thought out naming
* solid error handling
* extensibility/maintainability
* good design
* separation of concerns
* sensible breakdown of code into files/modules
* use of best practices
* appropriate use of tools/frameworks

Basically treat the coding test as if it's part of a larger problem.

Please try to limit your time on this project to 2-3 hours.
If you don't have time to implement something please document it in the README and discuss what you would do with more time during the interview.

Thank you!
