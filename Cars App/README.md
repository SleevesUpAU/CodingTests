# Cool Car App

## Context

- You have been asked to develop a front end by Fast Exotic Cars Pty Ltd
- The goal is to create a place for people to log and show off their "cool" cars

The application will consist of

- A dashboard showing a summary
- Details of each vehicle
- Information about how much the price of the vehicle has fallen
- Ability to add and remove vehicles

## Business Requirements

- You can only add cars from "cool" companies (as defined by Fast Exotic Cars Pty Ltd)
- Users will need to add in the purchase price of the vehicle when adding
- The UI/UX should be "exciting" to use and to show others

## Technical Constraints

- React or React Native
- Single Page Application is required for React
- Typescript is good to have, but not mandatory
- No persistent storage required
- No backend required

## Expectations

We're not just looking for any old solution that would solve the problem. We're looking for:

- production quality code
- good Object Oriented or functional practices
- a solid testing approach
- well thought out naming
- solid error handling
- extensibility/maintainability
- good design
- separation of concerns
- sensible breakdown of code into files/modules
- use of best practices when it comes to JS, CSS, testing etc.
- appropriate use of tools/frameworks

Basically treat the coding test as if it's part of a larger problem.

Please try to limit your time on this project to 2-3 hours.
If you don't have time to implement something please document it in the README and discuss what you would do with more time during the interview.
If you have any designs outside of code please bring them to the interview

Thank you!
