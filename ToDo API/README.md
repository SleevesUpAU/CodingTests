## Business Constraints
* Must not allow duplicated tasks
* Tasks must not be more than 240 characters

## Technical Constraints
* Springboot, NodeJS or .Net (as directed)

## Project Submission

The whole project including the source code, tests and simple documentation about how to run the program

Perferably, send us a link to a public repository including the above

## Expectations

We're not just looking for any old solution that would solve the problem. We're looking for:

* Production quality code
* Good Object Oriented or functional practices
* A solid testing approach
* Well thought out naming
* Solid error handling
* Extensibility/maintainability
* Good design
* Separation of concerns
* Sensible breakdown of code into files/modules
* Use of best practices
* Appropriate use of tools/frameworks

Basically treat the coding test as if it's part of a larger problem.

Please try to limit your time on this project to 2-3 hours.
If you don't have time to implement something please document it in the README and discuss what you would do with more time during the interview.

Thank you!
